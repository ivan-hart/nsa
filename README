## FAQ

#### What was the primary motivator to start this project?

I was in complete shock over the state of Kerbal Space Program 2 and decided that I'd take a wack at it to see how difficult it is. Plus it's a nice project to learn more about 3D graphics.

#### Why Odin?

I choose to use Odin as it provided me with the comfort of a more modern approach to a systems language but with less overhead like rust.

#### Why OpenGL?

I choose OpenGL over vulkan or direct x because I'm not familiar enough with both of those with the scope of this project in mind.

#### Why so many spelling mistakes?

I suck at spelling lol
